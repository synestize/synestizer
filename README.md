synestizer
==========

an app that helps you listen to colors.

This branch, alternate_patching, is a complete rebuild of the UI and synths
to make a simple analysis system with quasi-dynamic patching.

It is based on Rx.js.

It is missing  features of the master version, but saving grey hairs.
In particular, online app DOES NOT WORK AT ALL in this version and
*will* not unless we do a complete rewrite of that part.
(Which we will do if the alternate version proves that it is worth it ;-) )

Plans:

* implement a general scheduler
* Move video analysis into a Web Worker
* Make patching declarative
* have some nice synths
* Additional statistics
