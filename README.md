synestizer
==========

an app that helps you listen to colors.

This branch, alternate_patching, is a complete rebuild of the UI and synths
to make a simple analysis UI.

It is missing many lovely features of the master version, but saving many grey hairs.

In particular, online app DOES NOT WORK AT ALL in this version and will not unless we do a complete rewrite.

Plans:

* remove PubSub and go to Rx.js all the way
* implement a general scheduler
* implement arbitrary patching (this is what we really want to save online)
