synestizer
==========

[An app](https://github.com/synestize/synestizer/) that lets you hear color.
For more information on how, read the basic [documentation](https://synestize.github.io/synestizer/).

This branch, alternate_patching, is a complete rebuild of the UI and synths
to make a simple analysis system with quasi-dynamic patching.

It is based on Rx.js.

It is missing features of the master version, but saving grey hairs.
In particular, online app DOES NOT WORK AT ALL in this version and
*will* not until we do a complete rewrite.

Plans:

* implement a general scheduler for notes
* Move video analysis into a Web Worker
* have some nice synths
* Additional statistics
* dynamically load the readme text into the info tab
* Allow dynamic patch switching
