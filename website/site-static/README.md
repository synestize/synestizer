# synestizer

[An app](https://github.com/synestize/synestizer/) that lets you hear color.
For more information on how, read the basic [documentation](https://synestize.github.io/synestizer/).

Plans:

* document the crazy branch structure with static, django etc.
* implement a general scheduler for notes
* [Move video analysis into a Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers#Timeouts_and_intervals)
* have some nice synths
* Additional statistics
* dynamically load the readme text into the info tab
* Allow dynamic patch switching
* allow RANDOM patching
* allow partial modulation (i.e. not full-range for a given ensemble paramter)
