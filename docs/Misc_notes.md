# Notes

Notes auditioning for a place in the documentation

###  editing documentation

* [readthedocs for github](http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/webhooks.html)
* [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
* [macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
* [cactus](http://cactusformac.com/docs/) for OSX seems to do a lot of what we want.
* [prose](http://prose.io)
* [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) looks reasonably pretty and sells the output as a book on Amazon at the end

## Remote operation

* [tokbox](https://tokbox.com/)
* [webRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/)
* [binaryjs](https://github.com/binaryjs/binaryjs)
* [connecting spaces](http://tunnel.connectingspaces.hk)
* [shiftr](https://shiftr.io/)

## iOS version

... (is viable)[http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-native-iphone-ipad-apps-in-javascript/] but we won't start just yet.

## Desktop JS app options:

* [coccoonjs](https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/)
* [electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
* [node-webkit](http://nwjs.io/)
* [chrome app](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps)

## Android tablet version

Cheapest is amazon kindle, which supports
[native html5 web apps](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/platforms/webapps),
[decent hardware](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tablets/specifications/01-device-and-feature-specifications), but uses a
[special app store](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tablets).
Could we possibly get our app on that?
Would the browser APIs be modern enough?

## Multitouch
